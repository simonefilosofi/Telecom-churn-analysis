Telecom wants to understand what customers are more likely to churn (change provider), according to the available covariates so that it can target these customers with an ad-hoc promotional campaign.

## Tasks

1. **Build a classification model** to help Telecom in targeting the willing-to-churn customers before it is too late.  
2. **Cluster customers** according to their behavior.
